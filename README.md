* [wcs211/BEM-3D-Python](https://github.com/wcs211/BEM-3D-Python)

## Getting Started
* Edit the simulation input file [input_parameters.py](https://github.com/wcs211/BEM-2D-Python/blob/master/input_parameters.py)
* Execuite the file [bem2d.py](https://github.com/wcs211/BEM-2D-Python/blob/BEM2DFSI/bem2d.py) at the terminal prompt:

	$ python bem2d.py

## Features

* Modular code structure allows easier implementation of new features
* Multiple body interactions
* Implicit and Explicit Kutta condition enforcement
* Saves time-step data for post-processing
* Start from a previous data save
* Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI)

## Future Features
The following features have planned implementation in the code:

* Vortex Particle wake representation
* Lumped wake representation
* Equations of motion solver
* Boundary layer solver for skin friction estimation
* Quadtree collision detection (fencing scheme)
* Fast Multipole solver
* Parallel processing
* GPGPU processing
